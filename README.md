## 🔍 Reflection on PC Assembly Project

Through the PC Assembly project, I gained valuable hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of computer hardware components and their functions. This project allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world task, which significantly improved my technical confidence.

During the assembly process, I learned how to identify and correctly install key components such as the CPU, motherboard, RAM, power supply, storage devices, and graphics card. I also understood the importance of compatibility between components, such as socket types, power requirements, and case size, which is critical to ensure the system functions properly.

One of the most important skills I developed was problem-solving. I encountered challenges such as cable management and ensuring all components were securely connected. By carefully following manuals and checking connections step by step, I learned to troubleshoot issues systematically rather than relying on trial and error.

In addition, this project improved my awareness of hardware safety practices, including handling components carefully to avoid static damage and organizing cables to improve airflow and system stability. These practices are essential for building reliable and efficient systems.

Overall, the PC Assembly project enhanced my technical skills, attention to detail, and confidence in handling computer hardware. It also strengthened my interest in technology and provided a solid foundation for future learning in computer systems and information technology.
